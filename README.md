# gunshot_in_the_air
The recent news about gunshot in to the air may kill the others. We construct a calculation to find the horizontal and vertical distance in vary angle, neglect the air resistance and the change of air density in high altitude. Then plot the graph of bullet's trajectory.

Our bullet here is 9Ã—19mm Parabellum (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9%C3%9719mm_Parabellum) which has the mass 7.45-8.04 g depend on type. Here we use 7.45 g (115 gr) velocity 360 m/s Federal FMJ for a test. Only the velocity is use in this calculation.
